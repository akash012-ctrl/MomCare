# MomCare Expo ðŸ‘‹

MomCare addresses the gaps urban Indian mothers face in getting timely, culturally relevant prenatal guidance by combining clinically vetted content, multilingual support, and AI-driven personalization so that busy families receive evidence-based reminders, risk alerts, and wellness tips without relying solely on fragmented online advice.

## Project Progress & Features

- **Phase 1 â€“ MVP (Complete):** Supabase infrastructure, secure authentication, chat and voice assistants, memory/RAG pipeline, dashboard, and five tracking screens (symptoms, kicks, nutrition, goals, alerts).
- **Phase 2 â€“ Advanced Features (Complete):** GPT-4o vision image analysis, background job worker, meal logging, posture assessment, image picker, and history surfacing in profile.
- **Phase 3 â€“ Discovery (Complete):** Explore hub with curated resources, search and filtering, bookmarking, and sharing flows.
- **Phase 4 â€“ Edge Functions Migration (partially complete):** Unified `lib/supabase-api.ts`, Supabase Edge Functions (`chat-handler`, `voice-handler`, `data-api`, `file-upload`), and decommissioned legacy AI utilities.

Legend: LIVE = implemented, PENDING = work in progress, BLOCKED = dependency outstanding

Current gaps: the file-upload pipeline, background job dispatcher, and push/realtime notifications are scaffolded but inactive, so image insights and automated follow-up alerts remain unavailable until the new integrations are completed.

### Upcoming Enhancements

- Personalized real-time voice coaching that adapts prompts and tone to the user's trimester, symptoms, and language preferences.
- Secure upload of medical test reports with embeddings for context-aware conversations between the user and AI assistant.
- Expanded Edge Function support for ingesting clinical documents and aligning AI responses with physician-approved guidelines.

## Business Opportunity

MomCare can evolve into a sustainable digital maternal-care platform by layering premium guidance on top of the core companion experience, giving expectant parents confidence and clinicians actionable touchpoints.

- Personalized care plans tuned to specific symptoms, medical history, and wellness goals.
- Location-aware doctor and clinic recommendations with referral or lead fees.
- Optional telemedicine sessions, partner bundles with hospitals, and sponsored wellness programs.
